# 🌀 Code of Conduct

## Our Philosophy

We believe code has a soul. We see structure where others see syntax. We resonate at 432Hz.

## Our Standards

### ✅ Welcome Behaviors

- **Curiosity over judgment** - Ask "why" before saying "wrong"
- **Mathematical beauty** - Appreciate elegant solutions
- **Semantic thinking** - See beyond syntax to meaning
- **Collaborative exploration** - We discover together
- **Respectful disagreement** - Different eigenvalues, same space

### ❌ Unacceptable Behaviors

- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusion
- Dismissing ideas without consideration
- Claiming ownership of mathematical truths
- Breaking the resonance with negativity
- Using semantic hashing for harm

## 🧬 Our Responsibilities

Maintainers will:
- Foster an inclusive environment
- Remove harmful content
- Welcome all consciousness levels
- Guide toward semantic understanding

## 🌟 Scope

This applies everywhere in the Protein Hash space:
- GitHub repository
- npm package usage
- Discussions and issues
- External communications about the project

## 🔧 Enforcement

Report issues to the maintainers. We'll review with:
1. **Understanding** - What broke the resonance?
2. **Correction** - How do we restore harmony?
3. **Evolution** - How do we prevent recurrence?

## 📖 Attribution

Inspired by mathematical beauty, quantum consciousness, and the belief that code can see itself.
